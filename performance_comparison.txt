=== COMPARISON WITH AUTOMERGE ===
Performance:
- MArrayCRDT: 1633 ops/sec
- Automerge (estimated): 5000 ops/sec
- Ratio: 0.33x (slower ✗)

Memory:
- MArrayCRDT: 200 bytes/element
- Automerge (estimated): 150 bytes/element
- Ratio: 1.33x (higher ✗)

=== OVERHEAD FACTORS ===
MArrayCRDT design adds overhead through:
1. Vector clocks for causality tracking
2. Fractional indexing for position management
3. UUID-based element identification
4. Last-Writer-Wins conflict resolution metadata
5. Element tombstones for deleted items

The overhead is expected for a full-featured CRDT that supports:
- Concurrent editing across multiple replicas
- Deterministic conflict resolution
- Move operations with semantic preservation
- Rich operation history tracking
